"In the NoNicks operating system, the time required by a single file-read operation has four nonoverlapping components:
disk seek time-25 msec
disk latency time-8 msec
disk transfer time- 1 msec per 1,000 bytes
operating system overhead-1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec

"Suppose sharing of tiles in a multilevel directory structure is achieved with directory entries that are links pointing to a node containing information about a shared file. Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file.
