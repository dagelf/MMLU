Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?,"Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.","Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.",The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.,All of these options.,B
In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?,State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.,"With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.",The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.,The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.,B
Which of the following is not one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus?,Fiscal Discipline: budget deficits of no more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).,"Tax Reform: broadening the tax base, cut marginal tax rates, improve tax administration.",Property Rights: legal reforms to secure property rights without excessive costs and to regularize the informal sector.,Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.,D

What are the characteristics and manifestations of the strategy adopted by the USA in pursuit of energy security?,The deployment of troops in the Persian Gulf is part of the USA's attempt to secure its dominance in the oil-rich region.,All of these options.,"The USA has sought to assert its primacy vis-Ã -vis friendly and rival powers, through the deployment of troops and other interventions.",The USA has actively sought to stabilize oil-rich friendly political actors and secure the economic and political status quo.,B
Which of the following best describes the 'Orient' according to Edward Said?,"The Orient is a constructed subject that is imagined as inferior, irrational, and backward, in comparison to the West.",The Orient is a geographical term once used to describe the east Asia.,The Orient is an imagined concept that must be rejected by scholars in order to analyse security.,"Where there is an imbalance of power, the Orient is the dominant intellectual force or otherwise superior party.",A
How can we best describe liberalism?,Liberalism is a fundamentally pessimistic approach that regards the international system as destined to the escalation of conflict. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.,"Liberalism is a novel conception in the theory of international politics. It is an optimistic approach that defines the ways in which states should relate to one another, particularly during conflict situations.","Liberalism is an optimistic approach, offering an orientation for the better conduct of international affairs in the belief that a more peaceful world is possible. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.","Liberalism does not exist as a mainstream theory within International Relations, but rather offers a set of guidelines and advice for states and political actors wishing to accrue power within the international system independently from the restrictions of traditional security paradigms.",C
"Which of the following is not one of the unifying principles of Critical Security Studies, as defined by Krause?",Principle actors are social constructs that are made through political practices.,"Natural-science methodology is the best way to study social science, interpretive methodologies lack the coherence required for in-depth analysis.","Knowledge of the social world is not objective, as there is no divide between the social world and knowledge of that world.","The purpose of theory is not explanation in terms of generalizable causal claims, but contextual understanding and practical knowledge.",B
"Following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, what is the predominant paradigm in security and threat perception and to what extent is it an adequate response?","The security paradigm has been the development of multi-level analysis, to aid the understanding of disempowerment and to promote peace research involvement by NGOs, policy-makers, and the academic community.","The security paradigm of US led strategy has been the undertaking of short-term measures, many of which are drawn from research of the peace studies community. They focus on peace-keeping, peace-making, and structural change for preventing further conflict.","The security paradigm of recent years has been to some extent a reversion to 'liddism'; keeping the lid on a potentially fractured international system, without redress to the critical underlying causes of the problems.","The dominant approach to security studies has been a US led initiative which recognizes the need to undertake responsibility for inter-governmental cooperation, particularly for the commitment towards ethical intervention and for securing peaceful transformations alongside demilitarization of the international community.",C
In what ways has the concept of environmental security been contested?,"Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.",Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.,"The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.","The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralize the security of the state.",A
Which of the following best describes the 'subaltern' in postcolonialism?,Subaltern refers to those who are located geographically within the southern hemisphere.,The subaltern is a term applied to a specific group of scholars from the global south.,The subaltern refers to populations that are marginalised or outside of the hegemonic power structure.,The subaltern refers to the subcontinent of India.,C
What has been the effect of biological weapons on national security in the international community?,"The West, notably Canada, Britain, and the US, have conducted research into the weaponization of Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However biological weapons were generally viewed in the West as lacking military utility. Instead strategists have concentrated on nuclear and conventional capabilities.","The Soviet Union carried out the most extensive research program into genetic engineering to weaponize naturally occurring diseases. However, the Soviets most likely saw their biological weapons program as a counter to the global-strike complex that was emerging in NATO in the 1970s or as a way to inhibit recovery in a nuclear exchange. Biological weapons programs should therefore be regarded in a Cold War context.","Biological weapons make use of living organisms or toxins to weaken or kill, but because these organisms and toxins occur in nature it makes it difficult to differentiate between naturally occurring disease and subversive activities which, moreover, make a state's capacity hard to verify.",All of these options.,D
"Weak states face a number of security threats, which of the following threats is the odd one out?",Warlordism and the assertion of the interests and influences of criminal gangs.,A sudden influx of refugees fleeing conflict from neighbouring states.,"Coup d'Ã©tat, military rebellion or mutiny; the violent intervention in politics by the state's own military forces, overthrowing and replacing the ruling elite.",Competition for authoritative power or coercion from strongmen.,B
Which of the following statements does not characterise our understanding of disease pandemics within the contemporary international political system?,"Infectious disease transcends international borders and, to some extent, divisions of class, gender, education and wealth.","Whilst pandemics present a direct risk to national security, they also have the potential to undermine wider international stability.","Like terrorism, pandemics present a set of threats and risks that are diverse yet interconnected.",The existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious disease within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks.,D
What is Critical Security Studies?,An approach to security that applies critical knowledge to established orthodoxies of security studies.,"A specific theory of security that identifies clearly defined agents, threats, and processes.",A secondary term for the Copenhagen School of Security.,"A study security in which the critical importance of the state, military and traditional security are maintained.",A
How is a process of securitization completed?,"A process of securitization is when an issue not included in the political sphere becomes politicized and is managed within the political system. A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance.",A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitised when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process.,"Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings.","An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.",D
What was the importance of peace research during the 1980s?,Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.,"Peace research, in contrast to university IR, was under a great deal of pressure to deal with relevant issues with a high expectation of immediate delivery of policy answers.",There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.,The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.,C
Which of these statements does not describe the liberalist conception of the international system?,International politics is not the same everywhere; it is only 'realist' in certain places at certain times.,The nation state does not exist as a unitary actor within the international system.,Nation states are not basically alike.,States are and should remain the sole actors to be considered in the study of International Relations.,D
Is the weak state security dilemma an inescapable condition?,The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms.,"The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state.","The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America.","Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status. Long term security strategies have resulted in the adoption of measures to counteract the worst of the effects including the establishment of multi parties, economic liberalization and membership of the international community.",B
In what way might postcolonial analysis use the term 'thick space'?,"To describe the international as hierarchically ordered and comprised of a dense set of constructed political, economic, social, military and cultural relations.",To describe the international as a space generated by the knowledge and practice of Western powers to favour the so-called third world.,To describe countries that are oppressed or marginalised within imperial readings of IR.,To describe the power embodied by sovereignty and the Westphalian norms that underpin Eurocentric perceptions of the international.,A
Which approach or perspective dominates post-Cold War Security Studies?,An examination of the social processes by which groups of people construct something as a threat.,"A agenda for peace; peacekeeping, peace-making and conflict prevention as priorities for avoiding military confrontations.",The re-addressing of past practice as a possible cause of insecurity.,"The strategy for state security that is preoccupied with creating and maintaining a distribution of power in the system, beneficial in terms of maintaining security and stability.",C
What is the relevance of behaviour in economic security analysis?,"Economics as the science of individuals making decisions, and applying economic science to security, allows us to understand, predict, and respond to the behaviour of states and other security actors.",The growth of capitalism has catapulted the individual consumer to a place of extreme significance in shaping the global market. The behaviour of consumers dictates the nature of the global system.,"Behaviour, as a social constructivist concern, is not relevant to economic theory or security theory in general.","The behaviour of states is governed by their economic interests, in terms of securing favourable trade agreements and building strong domestic markets. Thus, their behaviour is dictated by economic considerations.",A
What differences emerged with regard to theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic?,"From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. The question of what should or what should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security.",The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.,The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.,Theorizing has parallel theoretical forms of knowledge based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships.,C
What is realism?,"Realism is a set of approaches to Security Studies that focuses on states, and tries to determine which strategy a state should adopt to achieve security and other goals.",Realism is the broad term that can be applied to any traditional approach to Security Studies.,Realism is a set of approaches that encompasses any security threat that involves the military.,Realism is defined by the belief that the behaviour of states constructs the international arena and that this behaviour is established through the internal environment of the state.,A
What techniques and targets belong to a workable definition of terrorism and terrorist concerns?,"Suicide attacks have been employed by terrorists having the advantage of enabling detonation at the last minute or when casualties will be maximized. A potential future danger is that a suicide attack could be combined with the use of chemical, biological or radiological weapons.","The ability to find vulnerable targets may be greater in democratic states since there are limitations on how much a government can monitor its citizen and will, in the event of an attack, generate more publicity. However, security forces in weak non-democratic countries also provide conditions conducive to terrorist activity, enabling relative freedom of operation and movement.","WMD have not been used very often, requiring high levels of resources and trained personnel for use. Furthermore, most terrorist groups still prefer to use more predictable methods for inflicting maximum casualties on the target. Yet to some extent, terrorist groups have gained a psychological edge because of the fear of use of WMD.",All of these options.,D
Describe the relationship between the military security domain and social constructivism.,"It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations.","Social constructivists reject the foundations of realism upon which military security studies are based; in rejecting the empirical basis of security studies, the social constructivist approach becomes inadequate in its attempts to formulate military security theory.",Social constructivism is based on philosophical ideas that directly contradict the foundations of military-centred theory. The tendency is for social constructivists to dismiss military endeavours as clumsy and as being detrimental to human security.,"In order to study military security, analysts must adopt a realist lens. However, this can later be combined with other approaches, including social constructivism, in order to consider the security of different referent objects such as the environment or human security.",A
How do gun shows and international arms fairs contribute to illicit arms markets?,"Although the subject of vocal opposition by campaigners, gun shows employ strict legal restrictions on participants, ensuring that those with criminal records are not able to purchase weapons.",Gun shows are regulated to ensure that weapons purchased legally cannot be resold on the black or grey markets.,Gun shows and arms fairs do not contribute in a significant way to the trade in illicit arms.,"Gun shows and arms fairs often do not require participants to undergo security checks before purchasing weapons, and encourage an environment where more attention is paid to price tags than details about where weapons will be distributed or used.",D
Which of the following was not stated as an objective of the Commission on Human Security when it was launched?,"To promote public understanding, engagement and support of human security and its underlying imperatives.",To develop the concept of human security as an operational tool for policy formulation and implementation.,To propose a concrete program of action to address critical and pervasive threats to human security.,To develop a new international justice system to enhance human security.,D
Has TNC become a national security threat?,"Transnational crime is regarded as a threat to economic development. Organized crime is seen as a threat to development insofar as it undermines the rule of law and deters foreign investment by increasing the level of insecurity in the host communities. Additionally, criminals often reinvest their proceeds in the legal economy and have unfair advantage through access to cheap capital and their ability to intimidate commercial adversaries. In societies with high levels of TNC, legitimate investors are often reluctant to commit resources.","TNC undermines democratic stability. In many states, transnational criminal enterprises have taken advantage of the instability that has accompanied the democratic transitions to post communist societies, using their influence in the upper reaches of the state and thus shielding themselves from law enforcement. The corruption of public institutions and the perceived inefficacy of the rule of law in new democracies contribute to undermining public confidence in and loyalty to the new regime.","The ability of transnational crime to evade state border controls and provide new avenues for the illicit transportation of goods and persons challenges the state's ability to exercise its core functions as guarantor of national sovereignty, the monopolization over the control of force, and as the provider of the common good. TNC criminal activities corrupt and undermine numerous state agencies, providing mechanisms by which their activities can affect the very nature of government and state policy in the host countries.",All of the above are correct.,D
"In defining the term 'historical materialism', which of the following statements best defines the term 'materialism'?","Materialism refers to HM's focus on class and the productive basis of societies, as well as the ways in which social structures have the capacity to change and produce change.",Materialism refers to the roots of HM in the postmodern schools of thought.,The term materialism refers to the focus of HM on consumerism and the centrality of economic power in the approach.,"In their rejection of class orientated political interaction, HM scholars refer to wealth instead as the accumulation or access to physical resources, coining the term materialism to describe this approach.",A
Which of the following is not a response to the illicit arms trade?,"2001 UN Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition.","2001 UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects.",2001 UN Security Council Resolution 1308 on HIV/AIDS as a National Security Threat.,2005 Marking and Tracing of Weapons Accord.,C
Which of the following statements best describes our understanding of the term 'globalization'?,"Globalization refers to the process by which shared hegemonic values pervade societies across the globe, drawing them into an ideological community, most often based on the economic principles of capitalism.","Best described as intensification of worldwide social relations and increasing interdependence, globalization is the result of the compression of space and time through the development of new technologies.","Globalization is best described as the 'shrinking' of the global community, drawing people into closer contact with one another primarily at the economic and technical levels. This process began in the early 20th century and was based on the ideological expeditions that originated from western Europe.","Globalization has occurred since the 1980s, originating in Western Europe as a centre of political power and technological advancement. The process is a direct result of technological advancement in communications and travel industries that facilitate the efficient transportation of physical objects, people and ideas across the globe.",B
What kind of actors are involved in the defence trade?,The defence trade concerns legitimate business interaction between states procuring or selling military equipment.,Military organisations are the sole actors in the defence trade.,"Not only state actors are involved in the defence trade. Non-state actors, including illegal groups, are also key players.",The defence trade refers solely to the trade in weapons and small arms that takes place outside the legal interactions between states.,C
"To what extent is TNC linked with terrorism, and in what ways?",There is growing evidence of direct partnerships between terrorist groups and transnational criminal organization resulting from the end of the Cold War and the need to secure new forms of financial sponsorship. For most terrorist groups criminal activity has been amongst the most important sources of funds with the diffusion of terrorist networks globally operating in correlation to the diffusion of illicit market activities.,The nexus between terrorist groups and criminal organizations are generally a temporary aberration. Differential long-term strategic goals meant that levels of cooperation were generally tactical temporary alliances that would have little pervasive effects.,"There is increasing evidence over the convergence of terrorism and transnational crime, but there is no consensus about whether this phenomenon is a long-term strategic alliance or episodic ""marriages of convenience"".",All of these options.,C
Which statement best describes the relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s?,"Both peace researchers and realists advocated an academic focus on the escalation of the arms race. Although tensions existed between the groups in terms of their proposed solutions to this crisis, there existed a consensus that the Soviet bloc should be eliminated as a nuclear threat, thus favouring the survival of Western liberal democracies.","In contrast to the realist school, peace researchers looked beyond the accumulation of nuclear weapons for a focus to their studies; this resulted in tensions between the two groups, with the former believing that the attainment of superior military strength was paramount to achieving security.","Whilst peace researchers indentified the escalation of the arms race as a result of failures by the League of Nations, realist scholars deemed it to be the natural progression of ideological differences between the Soviet bloc and Western liberal democracies. This resulted in irreconcilable differences between the study agendas of realists and peace researchers.","The East-West divide of the Cold War gave rise to a sharp divide between realists and early peace studies theorists. Whilst realists wished to focus research on that which would favour the survival of Western liberal democracies, advocates of peace studies regarded this approach as being narrow and Western ethnocentric.",D
Which of the following is an important outcome of the 'energy security nexus'?,Attempts to exert control over energy reserves in the South have consequences for the sustainability of cooperation between core powers; the emergence of geopolitical rivalries over this form of control has implications for international security.,All of these options.,"United by common insecurities concerning the production and supply of energy resources, international actors are forced into negotiation and cooperation between states increases.","By virtue of their energy resources to which the global 'North' desires access, states in the 'South' gain power in the international arena and have redressed the global North-South divide and associated inequalities.",A
In what ways did strategic circumstances have an effect on environmental security perspectives?,The end of the Cold War created the space for security policy and security studies to be re-considered in light of growing environmental consciousness underlined by multilateralism in policy action.,In 1973 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restricted oil supplies which underlined the industrial capacity of the military leaving a profound psychological impact requiring that security be linked to national interests: the securing of energy deals and the environment became related to military capability diplomacy.,Ideologically driven military security was replaced by a need to preserve territorial integrity in wake of the collapse of communism. Military security was a high priority given the threat of spill-over. The environment remained a peripheral concern to the security institutions occupied with the new security environment post-Cold War.,"The end of the Cold War order created the intellectual space for the broadening of security issues beyond Cold War military mentalities. Research among political and environmental scientists discussed ways in which new security issues could be addressed. The plethora of publications produced, however, had little effect on policy.",A
The following statements define the conceptualization of 'class' within HM; which is incorrect?,All advocates of HM accept that social class is important.,"Within the HM paradigm, the only form of class that matters is social class.",The focus of HM lies predominantly on class and class in relation to capital.,HM regards class as being far more complex than a simple division between a capitalist ruling class and working class.,B
What factors enabled the expansion of transnational crime (TNC) in the 1990s?,"Transnational crime developed as a result of the declining expenditure on defence and the standing down of armies, which reduced the risk of activities.",TNC as a concept emerged in the academic sphere as linked to human security concerns and developmental opportunities in weak states as a means of conflict resolution and peace building in Europe.,"Transnational criminal activities have always been a feature of the international system. In the policy community, the growth of interest in TNC is due to the increasing sophistication of intelligence and communications technology, which has enabled the true representation of the scale and the scope of the problem to be known.",International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime.,D
Which of the following statements is not applicable to the Securitization process?,Securitization reveals the power of the securitizing actor.,"Where the securitizing actor is a democratic state, the relevant audience is usually the wider population who have the right to reject the speech act.",The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat.,"Within authoritarian and other undemocratic regimes, the relevant political decision-making is often dominated by the military and political elite.",C
Which of the following is not a purported limitation of the liberalist approach?,Liberalism poses great difficulty in defining when the use of force would be justified or necessary.,"Liberalism is often internally inconsistent, limiting its applicability for use as a guide.",A failure to address the importance of a wide range of actors in the decision-making processes of the international system.,"Liberalist influence merely reflects Western dominance, potentially undermining its relevance in the future.",C
Which of these statements is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the twentieth century?,"Within peace studies, one of the later developments was a major interest in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and peacekeeping.","At the height of the Cold War, peace studies was frequently labelled 'appeasement studies' and was bitterly opposed by critics.","By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts.",Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state centric view of major issues of conflict.,C
What role does 'Information' play in the economic science of decision making?,"Information is not important to decision making in economic theory; rather, it is an actor's perceptions of situations that will inform their decision making process.","Information has no special significance to economic decision making, which is guided more by external forces that coerce actors than their own rational choices.","Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.",Information has become an important resource in the 21st century and can be sold and traded as a market commodity.,C
Which of the following did not emerge as a trend of the defence trade in the 20th century?,The arms trade shifts from being a private to a government controlled enterprise.,An increase in the defence trade.,A decrease in the arms trade.,A growth in the number and variety of weapons traded.,C
Which of these statements defines the Copenhagen School's view of security?,"Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective.","Security is best defined using the traditional paradigm, with the state as the referent object to be secured using extraordinary measures where possible.","To best understand security one must adopt a constructivist approach, threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures.","Security exists as an empirically verifiable and independent condition that changes only slightly, if at all, with regards to the social context in which it is applied.",A
Which of these best describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity?,The inherent promotion of feminine characteristics in society.,Social dominance of men over women that results from the designation of 'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics.,All of these options.,The acknowledgement that gender identity exists in many forms and is not binary.,B
How do institutional constraints affect behaviour?,Institutional constraints limit the amount of resources to be spent on some good and force actors to choose how to manage the limited wealth available to them.,Institutions are the social norms and expectations that affect an actor's goals and ambitions.,"Institutional constraints refer to tools of the state such as schools, prisons, and hospitals; the provision of resources for these institutions makes demands on political leaders.","Institutions are humanly devised constrains that structure human interaction, they are man-made rules that guide decision making and govern behaviour.",D
Which of the following policies is not true of economic policy?,"Economic policies must take into account the incentives of not only the leaders, but the populations intended to influence.",Policymakers can incentivize security-promoting behaviours in others through the use of sanctions and aid.,"Trade policies can entice leaders to change behaviours in exchange for access to markets or trade preferences, and advance security.","Concern with poverty is a humanitarian issue that has no direct link to economic science, although it might be alleviated through aid.",D
Which of the following is not an assertion made in the realist case against humanitarian inventions?,Armed force should only ever be used in the national interest and that humanitarian intervention is therefore imprudent.,"Foreign intervention reduces the proportion of wars that end in outright victory, it leaves behind an unstable peace that is likely to reignite.",Foreign intervention tends to prolong wars; it is inappropriate and does not work.,"Humanitarian intervention prioritises the human as the referent object of security, undermining the state-centric approach of realism.",D
Which of the following statements best describes the orientation of military security within the traditional conception of security studies?,"Strategic studies are the central concern of international relations, within strategic studies, the subset of security studies focuses on military security.","Military security is a central concern within international relations and dominates the scholarship. Within international relations, strategic studies form a subset of academic interest, within which security studies feature occasionally.","Strategic studies are best conceptualized as a subset of international relations, and within strategic studies, military security is one of the dominant concerns. Security studies are a subset of strategic studies.","Military security is the central concern of strategic studies; and strategic studies are a subset of security studies. Military security is one of the central concerns of security studies, and security studies is a subset of international relations.",D
"Which of these statements characterizes the traditional concept of national security, as opposed to human security?",All of these options.,"In the national security approach, real threats are only those posed to human life, human rights, or human dignity.",The traditional interpretations of security and threats are important boundaries that define human security.,The concept of national security is too narrow to be useful when analysing the broad threats that currently exist.,D
How does Buzan's concept of 'societal security' mark a departure from traditional understandings of security?,"Securing the sustainable development of the state was dependent on societal security as an independent interest that was not secondary or dependent on the other sectors, including the military.","The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.","Societal security referred to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Military threats could be subdivided to include the infrastructural strength, the technology, personnel, the economic base and the political base of the military security sector.",Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. Security was dependent on factors beyond geographically conceived survival: survival of the state was superseded by survival of the nation (ethnic) state.,B
Which of the following conditions does not constitute 'human security'?,"A condition where people are given relief from the traumas that afflict human development, are safe from threats and are protected from hurtful disruptions to their daily lives.","A condition in which every citizen is free from the threat of physical violence, regardless of their race, ethnicity or other identity.","A condition where people are guaranteed the ability to live and develop, free from political oppression or prejudice, safe from threats posed by their own or external state actors.","A condition where people exist independently of state support, where human life is self-sufficient in that individuals do not require the assistance of state apparatus in order to live securely.",D
What are the effects of nuclear weapons?,"A nuclear blast produces EMP, a thermal light pulse, blast, and fallout at the moment of detonation. The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), ""the Compton effect."" EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns.",A nuclear detonation produces a shockwave resulting from a rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure sufficient to destroy concrete structures. Blast effects were generally used by military planners to calculate casualty rates in a nuclear attack: It was estimated that 50 percent living in a five mile radius of a one-mgt airburst would be killed or wounded by blast effects.,"Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect. Panic set off by even a limited dispersion of radioactive material might be more costly in terms of the disruption it causes than actual casualties or damage to property produced by a dirty bomb detonation; some observers believe that the blast itself causes the greatest amount of damage.",All of the above,D
What do critics fear would be the result of granting rights of humanitarian intervention?,An abuse of this power in order to wage state-interested wars.,"A depletion of military resources pursuing wars on ethical grounds, leading to a loss of military security.","Whilst some states have proven their ability to conduct 'just' wars in order to protect sound values of democracy and neoliberalism, not all states would use force to pursue such globally beneficial ends.","A lack of implementation of these rights by state actors, leading to a failure to address human rights abuses.",A
"According to George and Simons, what factors influence the outcomes of an act of coercive diplomacy?",Global strategic environment; type of provocation; image of war.,Unilateral or coalitional coercive diplomacy; isolation of the adversary; clarity of objective; strength of motivation and asymmetry of motivation.,Sense of urgency; strong leadership; domestic support; international support; opponents fear of unacceptable escalation; clarity concerning the precise terms of settlement.,"All of these options. George and Simons distinguish between contextual variables and conditions favouring success, and the idea that they should be used by decisionmakers at different stages in the policymaking process.",D
What is the significance of anarchy to the realist explanation of international politics?,Anarchy means that the state exists as part of society being indistinguishable from national government and the domestic character of the state.,"Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling power beyond the multiple states. In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour.","Anarchy means that there is little continuity in a government's foreign policy over time. Leaders come and go and their foreign policy changes, which is reflective of different preoccupations and ideologies.","Anarchy means that the structure of the international system is distinctive because states have a strong sense that they are part of a larger entity in international politics with overarching interests and goals, making association unlimited and important.",B
Which of the following ideas have become mainstreamed within human security since the Human Development Report?,Limiting security analysis to military engagement is too restrictive.,Security is a contestable concept.,Focusing security only on violent conflicts is too restrictive.,All of these options.,D
Which of the following statements best describes the characteristics of a weak state?,"The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent.","Weak states possess high levels of social-political cohesion which is correlated to the hegemonic enforcement idea of the regime, which in turn becomes accepted to the point of being legitimized as the social norm.","Weak states have a monopoly on the instruments of violence and have the coercive capability to force compliance even when social actors attempt to resist. The regimes lack popular legitimacy, the integrity of the regime's survival is consolidated by power resulting in the naturalization of violence within society.","Weak states do not utilize coercive capabilities in normal policy. State institutions typically have a developed bureaucracy which legitimizes the regime's ability to rule. Paradoxically, however, the more a weak state exercises its coercive power the more it reinforces its infrastructural power but reduces its ability to rule.",A
What is distinguishable about security studies theory?,"Security studies theory refers to the historical systematic distinction between strategic studies and security studies and the interrelation between general International Relations (IR) theory, security studies, and security theory.","The centre of the security studies debate has been to give form to policy questions - strategy, economy of defence, decision making - and to the systematic division of labour that has governed those distinctions.","Security theory is a specific subset of security studies and one whose development has gone through distinctive phases and divided more strongly than comparable fields, often without mutual recognition.","Security debates structured scholarship centred on offensive versus defensive realism, the relative importance of ideational variables and the role of power and institutions in orders and empires.",C
What would be the policy implications of a hierarchical vision of TNC?,Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential.,"The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.",Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.,Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.,D
In what ways is gender applicable to the field of Security Studies?,Women and children are dependent on the state for protection and Security Studies should include them and account for their needs.,Biological differences between men and women determine their suitability for different roles in protecting the state or referent object.,Gender is not applicable to Security Studies - to create a 'gender neutral' security arena we should disregard gender issues.,"Social constructions of 'masculinity' or 'femininity' determine the roles in which men and women are expected to act, by considering these artificial roles we can ask important questions about the ways in which we conceptualize security.",D
What external strategies do elites employ?,An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants.,Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance frequently are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met.,An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats.,Weak states may sometimes militarily engage in action to bolster their regional position and to mobilize internal support against the construction of an imagined external threat. This frequently coincides with economic or social crises as a policy of distraction.,C
What is the market vision of transnational organized crime?,Market place scholars argue that transnational crime operates like a capitalist marketplace in its scope and extensity of operations. Criminal organizations are thus very resilient to law enforcement efforts by virtue of their sheer size. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace.,Market analysts argue that the criminal alliances create organizations with a high level of wealth and power that far underestimates what government and official estimates attribute to them. Within this perspective the threat to the licit economy is vastly increased.,Market analysts believe that white-collar and corporate crimes contribute significantly to undermining the licit market. Those organized crime groups are more prone to use violence and corruption than ordinary criminal groups as a result of the extent of profits invested in their activities.,"Market analysts claim that organized crime is highly disorganized, and resembles more a market for illicit goods and services than an organization. Proponents of this view minimize the threat posed by organized criminals to states and societies.",D
In what ways might the effects of chemical weapons affect the decision to deploy them against a target?,"Chemical weapons are a highly complicated means to conduct an assault. The unpredictability of chemicals (the degree of evaporation, stability and concentration) frequently proves to be incommensurate with political objectives.","Analysts are concerned with the potential ease of chemical manufacturing. Weapons could be quickly and effectively deployed being light, concealable and rapidly deployed. Most weapons can be delivered in a line source for example a crop duster or administered through an aerosol. Dispersal in areas of poor ventilation or closed venues where people are in close proximity could have potentially catastrophic effects.",Chemical weapons have the potential to cause mass casualties. Moderate exposure to chemicals produces serious side effects and would generate serious casualties if weaponized.,"Wind, temperature and terrain can affect the lethality and persistence of an agent and is dependent on the extensity and degree of contact with the target.",D
In what ways is defining coercive diplomacy success problematic?,"Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the ""stick"" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.","Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.","In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.","Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.",D
Which statement best describes the liberalist attitude towards international organisations?,Liberalism holds that international organisations can enhance national and international security. It advocates the inclusion of non-governmental organisations and other actors to encourage cooperation and build communities.,The liberalist advocacy of cooperation as enhancing security is undermined by the failure of international organisations such as the league of nations in preventing global conflicts.,"Under liberalism's different schools of thought, there is a general consensus that the involvement of international organisations in the political system ultimately undermines security by disempowering the state as a unitary actor.",All of these options.,A
What is the relationship between culture and social constructivism?,All of the below.,"Culture is the product of shared identity and interaction, although it is important in understanding the dynamics of social identity, its wider reference to security studies is largely disputed.","Social constructivism does not regard culture as being an important feature to study, instead focusing on individualistic aspects of identity such as personal interests and ambition.",Culture is commonly regarded as a set of practices that give meaning to shared experiences and actions; it can impact on how states see security and is crucial in constructing the values and rules that inform identity.,D
"According to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde, in what ways does the Copenhagen School's approach to Security Studies differ from that of Critical Security Studies?","The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.","Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.","Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.",Neither Critical Security Studies nor the Copenhagen School account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security.,A
In what ways might a society be threatened?,Societies are threatened when their linguistic heritage and traditions are under attack. The inability to use and develop traditional language signifies the destruction of a society.,Threats to societal security exist when a society regards its collective identity as being under question. Such circumstances include the suppression of expression and interference with a society's ability to reproduce itself across generations.,"Military threats to societies in the form of external aggression, mainly through de-population policies with the intent of preventing collective identities from being reproduced over generations.",Migratory influxes into a host receiving state results in a shift in the composition of the population resulting in horizontal competition or vertical competition. This is not an outright threat to survival but part of wider uncontrollable processes of evolutionary identity.,B
In what ways has conflict been a concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states?,"Environmental change can be a cause of war between countries, largely centred on resource scarcity interrelated with conflict. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.","Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.","Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.",Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.,D
What is the 'security dilemma' that faces weak states?,The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.,"The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.","The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.","Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence. Social disquiet is a semi-permanent situation of emergent but not developed anarchy.",A
Which of the following does not constitute a fundamental ontological principle of social constructivism?,"Normative or ideational structures are important and matter as much as, if not more than, material structures.",Identities are important.,Anarchy is an inescapable feature of the international system.,Agents and structures are mutually constituted.,C
Historical materialism is founded on the ideas and philosophies of which theorists?,Barry Buzan and Ole Waever,Kenneth Waltz and Hans Morgenthau,Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels,Adam Smith and Karl Marx,C
In what ways does the perspective on terrorism influence the response a government will take?,"Within the disease prescription, reform packages become part of the government response to reduce the appeal of the terrorist group within the population. However, reforms may encourage terrorists to continue their violent activities because they are being rewarded. Under these conditions reforms may become concessions that fuel the violence rather than a mechanism for ending it. It is also clear that reforms may not eliminate the presence of terrorism.","Contemporary responses to terrorism have been taken within the context of the war on terror analogy, in which the norms of retaliation and punishment prevail. Implicit within this view is the justification for pre-emptive action taken against training facilities, headquarters, sources of funding, and even the assassination of key individuals.","Whilst the warfare analogy presumes deterrence at times, deterrence is more central to a justice system. The extent of pre-emption available in a normal criminal context is the detention of suspects or judicial harassment.","All of these options. Responses to terrorist attacks vary either explicitly or implicitly, if warfare is seen as warfare, crime, or disease.",D
How might the period of academic institutionalization be assessed?,"The distinct phenomenon of strategic studies emerged as an imported American specialty. It emerged in the US and was exported to Europe. European security studies was ""theory has already been done"" kind of work.",The think tanks became routine producers of narrow technical problem-solving succumbing to 'hectic empiricism': the internal logic of its key contribution (deterrence) broke down.,"Peace research developed on a parallel but separate track, and particularly the distinct critical branch was seen neither by its representatives nor by security studies as part of the latter.",All of these options.,D
"The concept of R2P rests on three pillars, which of these is widely acclaimed to be the most important?",The responsibility to retaliate.,The responsibility to prevent.,The responsibility to rebuild.,The responsibility to react.,B
What is the future of WMD?,"The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit. Whilst they may serve some utility as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, they are essentially toothless bodies lacking the political will to establish an authority with the powers to police the control and use of these weapons.",The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD. This has been evidenced by severe splits in the body following the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and the withdrawal of great power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.,Contemporary concern has been pacified by the fact that WMD threat has greatly diminished with the end of the Cold War. A number of deployed Soviet (Russian) and strategic warheads and US tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from service thereby removing the threat of total war by massive nuclear exchange.,"WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated.",D
In what ways can the different relationship between US and European security studies be explained?,"The different relationship to the concept of security: in Europe the debate has stayed as part of politico-self-reflection of the scholar who 'does security;' whereas in the US, the question of the concept of security is seen at the most a necessary 'define your' terms' operation.","The different relationship to the exact form of knowledge that is valued. The US is more rationalist, Europe the more reflectivist. In the US security studies debate hypothesis is typically examined as cause-effect relationships, tied into general debates and with measurement of ideational variables.","In the US major competing explanations emphasized, on the one hand, the US's liberal hegemony, and, on the other hand, the purely power based stability of presumed unipolarity in which balancing becomes impossible.",All of these options.,D
Which of the following statements does not describe 'nations'?,Nations may be made up of different ethnic-identity groups.,Nations may be difficult to distinguish from societies.,Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state.,Nations may contain multiple religious identity groups.,C
In what ways have feminist and critical security investigations of the 1980s and 1990s expanded our understanding of gender security issues?,Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets. Women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance.,"Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community.","Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles.","The literature that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s was primarily concerned with the ways in which women had served the purposes of nationalist campaigns, focusing on the biological characteristics of women as sexually reproductive beings, and with little focus on critical analysis.",C
"Within Critical Security Studies, what is the referent object of security?",There is no specific referent point.,The state and state apparatus.,The environment.,The people and their collectives.,A
